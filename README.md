# JS key concepts and documentation

* HTML -> Nouns

Javascript is **dynamic typing**: we don't have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable.

## Type conversion and coercion

**Type conversion** is when we manually convert form one type to another.

**Type coercion** is when JS automatically converts behind the scenes for us.

Examples:

```js
'23' - '10' -3 => 10 //number
'23' / '2' => 11.5 //number
2 + 4 + 3 + '5' => '95' //string
```
